# Streaming Feature Demo

The AI agent now supports **real-time streaming responses** from OpenAI's chat completions API! This creates a much more interactive and engaging experience.

## What's New

### ðŸ”„ **Real-time Streaming**
- Responses appear as the AI generates them, word by word
- No more waiting for the complete response
- More natural conversation flow

### ðŸ’­ **Visual Streaming Indicators**
- `ðŸ’­ AI Agent:` prefix shows when streaming starts
- Real-time text output using `process.stdout.write()`
- Seamless integration with tool execution

### âš¡ **Technical Implementation**
- Uses OpenAI's streaming API with `stream: true`
- Handles streaming content and tool calls simultaneously  
- Maintains conversation history correctly
- Graceful fallback for non-streaming scenarios

## How It Works

1. **Stream Setup**: The agent sets up a streaming callback function
2. **Real-time Output**: Content streams directly to console as it's generated
3. **Tool Integration**: Tool calls are handled seamlessly during streaming
4. **Complete Messages**: Full responses are still stored for conversation history

## Code Changes Made

### `src/ai-agent.ts`
- Added `onStreamingContent` callback property
- Replaced `callOpenAI()` with `callOpenAIStreaming()`
- Implemented chunk-by-chunk content processing
- Enhanced tool call handling during streaming

### `src/index.ts`
- Set up streaming callback in constructor
- Modified console output to work with streaming
- Improved response formatting

## Example Output

```
ðŸ§  Processing your query...

ðŸ”§ Executing tool: list_indices

ðŸ’­ AI Agent: Based on the available indices, I can see you have several types of data in your Elasticsearch cluster...

[Text continues to stream in real-time as the AI generates it]

==================================================
```

## Performance Benefits

- **Faster perceived response time** - Users see output immediately
- **Better user engagement** - More natural conversation feel  
- **Transparent processing** - Users see the AI "thinking" in real-time
- **Maintained accuracy** - All tool calls and data processing remain intact

## Usage

The streaming feature is automatically enabled when you run the agent. No additional configuration needed!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

The streaming works seamlessly with all existing features:
- Database exploration
- Query refinement
- Tool execution
- Final responses via the reply tool
